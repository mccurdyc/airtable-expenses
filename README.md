# airtable-expenses
---

This is a project that I created to test out [Airtable](https://airtable.com/),
a spreadsheet-like UI, with database properties such as relationships between
sheets. This specific project is the code that I used to migrate from a Google Sheet
with a single sheet to Airtable with multiple tables.

## Important Notes

[Here is a link](https://airtable.com/shrRW6c3cMnoiz3KB) to the Airtable Base that I created
and can be copied.

Airtable generates an API specific to your table, see the documentation [here](https://airtable.com/api).
> After youâ€™ve created and configured the schema of an Airtable base from the graphical
> interface, your Airtable base will provide its own API to create, read, update,
> and destroy records.

With that said, use this as an example as it is not a generalized tool.

## Comments on Airtable After Usage

### What I like

### What I dislike
+ can only GET by Airtable ID, which means that I have to GET ALL and store ID in memory
+ no `UNIQUE` fields like in a relational database
+ some JSON fields are camelCase, others PascalCase in the API
+ in my experience, in the iOS mobile application, you can only search records
  by the primary key, which I have set as an auto-incremented integer instead of a string.
  + for this, I have considered setting the primary keys as the names of merchants, tags, etc.,
    but I am used to IDs as the primary key.
